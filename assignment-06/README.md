How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

It should have one of each. 

The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

The body element is the container for all renderable aspects of a document. 

Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural Markup is markup in any language that gives information about the structure of a document.

Semantic markup is the use of a markup language such as HTML to convey information about the meaning of each element in a document through proper selection of markup elements.
