        Directions
    </h1>

    <ol>
        <!-- used the sup as a semantic element-->
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400<sup>o</sup> F.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Can be made ahead and refrigerated for a day or two</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate the butter into a small bowl and place in the freezer for about 8-10 min.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl mix flour, salt, and cheese.</li>
        <li>When the butter is nice and cold, mix into the flour with a pastry cutter (I 100% used my hands and just worked quickly so as not to melt the butter).</li>
        <li>When the mixture begins to clump together, slowly add water.<em> Only add as much as needed to form a ball! </em>Start with ¼ cup and increase as you mix. You don’t want a wet dough.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface shape ball into a disc and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for an hour before using.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Meanwhile Make the Onions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add in onions and stir frequently so they can brown but not burn. Adjust the heat as necessary.</li>
        <li>After about 20 minutes add sugar and season with a bit of salt.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking and stirring until onions are a deep golden brown. This can take about 45 minutes but they could go for an hour. Just don’t wander away and leave them unattended, they can stick and burn.</li>
        <li>When the onions have acquired that nice deep golden tan, add in the sage and cook for about a minute, then add the wine and cook for about 2-3 minutes more, until the liquid has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Set aside to cool before assembling the galette.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Galette</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400° F.</li>
        <li>Lay out a large sheet of parchment paper on your work surface.</li>
        <li>Remove dough from refrigerator and with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out dough into a somewhat circle-shape (doesn’t need to be perfect) about 1/4 in. thick.</li>
        <li>Place about ½ of the onions in the center of the dough, followed by all of the garlic, and about ½ of the potato slices. Leave about a 1 ½ to 2 inch border between the filling and the edge of the dough.</li>
        <li>Lightly season with salt and pepper and top with ½ of the cheese and thyme.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with ½ of the butter mixture.</li>
        <li>Follow with the rest of the potatoes, more salt and pepper, the remaining onions*, cheese and thyme and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Fold the edges of the dough over, brush with egg wash, and bake for about 45-50 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let cool for about 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
