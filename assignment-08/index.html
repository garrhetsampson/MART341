<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>In fields where nothing grew but weeds
I found a flower at my feet
Bending there in my direction
I wrapped a hand around its stem
I pulled until the roots gave in
Finding now what I've been missing
But I know</p>

<p>So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice</p>

<p>All you have to do is shout it out
Inside my hands these petals browned
Dried up, falling to the ground
But it was already too late now
I pushed my fingers through the earth
Returned this flower to the dirt
So it could live; I walk away now
But I know</p>

<p>Not a day goes by that I don't feel its burn
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice</p>

<p>All you have to do is shout it out
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
Inside these arms of yours
All because of you
I believe in angels
Not the kind with wings
No, not the kind with halos
The kind that bring you home
When home becomes a strange place
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out
</p>
