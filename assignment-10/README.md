Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

A: Universal applies to everything. Element applies to only a select group. Class applies to a specific group. ID Selectors apply to those that have been highlighted or boxed in with "<><>" tags.

Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.

A: I wanted to choose a cooler natural color palette so I chose #e1e6df, #1b1b1b for a dark contrast, and #736f30 for highlights.

Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.

A: This week I'm starting a new job as a front end developer and designer for the Rocky Mountain School of Photography! The interview process was a little nerve wracking but I'm really excited about the new opportunity.
