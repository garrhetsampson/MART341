Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.
A web browser is software that processes and accesses the internet. I currently use mostly safari but I have been using Brave as often as possible.

What is a markup language? Describe one commonly used in development.
A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. Some examples of a markup language are BBC, HTML, SGML, and XML.
