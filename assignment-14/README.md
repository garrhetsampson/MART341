Your README file for this homework's repo should also include:

What library did you choose?

HTML 5. Since this is the library I am most familiar with that's the one I wanted to test out.

Did you use a local file or CDN? Why?

Local. I find local repositories easier to work with.

How does HTML5 change the web?

HTML 5 made it easier to add responsive elements into webdesign. IT opened the web for mobile devices.

Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how you overcame them.

This week was actually kind of a busy one. Between school and my new job I'm really looking forward to summer where I can focus on some of my own design projects.
